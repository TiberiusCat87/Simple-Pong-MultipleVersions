# Simple-Pong-MultipleVersions
Q1

Basic pong-styled game that includes a paddle controlled by the player and a ball the player must hit.

The player is able to move using arrow keys. Other versions allow for two-player compatibility (able to move using WASD keys) and CPUs with varying difficulties.

Changelogs:
Version 1: Single player

Version 2: Includes two paddles for two players compatibility.

Version 3: Topmost paddle controlled by CPU. Removed two player compatibility.

Version 4: Difficulty can be chosen. Depending on the difficulty, the speed of the ball may change while also getting more difficult as the game progresse.
